# Payroll-Smart-Contract

This smart contract is an hypothetical one for an employer to their employee. This is how it works, the employer can:

- add employees
- update employee details and allowance
- pay in USD per hour
- ascertain the status of an employee's payment

The employee can also withdraw so far they pass the check.

I learned a lot of new things and refreshed my memory.
